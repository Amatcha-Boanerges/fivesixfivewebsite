## What is Culture Transformation?

Culture transformation is a strategic process of aligning an organization's culture with its business goals and vision for the future. It involves deeply understanding the existing culture—the shared values, beliefs, behaviors, and systems that guide how work gets done—and intentionally shifting it to a desired future state.

This is not just about changing a few superficial elements; it's about fundamentally reshaping the work environment to empower employees, foster innovation, and drive sustainable performance.
